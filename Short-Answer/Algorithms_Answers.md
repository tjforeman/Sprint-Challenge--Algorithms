#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^2) - This algorithm is O(n) because it adds n * n to a since n is run twice it's O(n^2) , taking up much more time as data increases. 


b) O(n^2) - This algorithm is O(n^2) because it has both an outer and an inner loop meaning the more data it processes the longer it will take to run. 


c) O(n) - This algorithm is O(n) because it's recursive which acts in a linear manner

## Exercise II


take the amount of floors (n) and divide it by two, check to see if the egg is broken when dropped from the new floor. 

if the egg is not broken continue to divide the floors by two until the egg is broken when dropped

when the egg breaks from a floor that was divided by two 
check between the middle and top and keep going until the highest possible floor where the egg survives is found which is f

the run time complexity for this would be O(log n)
